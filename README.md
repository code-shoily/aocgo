# aocgo - Advent of Code solutions in Go

## What is Advent of Code?

[This](https://adventofcode.com). Every year since 2015, starting December 1 to 25, 25 small programming problems are presented on http://adventofcode.com. The challenges are fun to solve in programming language of your choice. I mostly solved those with [Elixir in the past](https://github.com/code-shoily/advent_of_code), but am looking forward to play with Golang in future challenges. And as I am trying really learn Go, I felt like I should backfill the old challenges throughout 2023.

## How do I run these?

I have not done any `make-fu` yet. So as of today, the way to run this is just `cd` into the `year` and `dayXX` and `go test` and `go run main.go`. I will automate things later.
